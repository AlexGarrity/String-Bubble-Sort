# String-Bubble-Sort
After being inspired by the many useless features of VB.net, I decided to implement > and &lt; for strings in C++.

# Compilation
It's pretty simple, no additional libraries or anything required.
I compiled with the command
> clang++ Main.cpp -std=c++11 -O4

You could just copy and paste the code into an IDE as well.
